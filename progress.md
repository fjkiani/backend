# Project Progress Summary

This document summarizes the key features and milestones accomplished in the Market Intelligence Dashboard project.

## Core Features Implemented:

1.  **News Integration:**
    *   Successfully integrated news fetching and display from two sources:
        *   **Trading Economics:** Implemented web scraping (initially via Diffbot structure, later refactored to parse HTML) with caching and duplicate detection.
        *   **RealTimeNews:** Integrated via its RapidAPI endpoint using a structured adapter pattern (`RealTimeNewsAdapter`, `NewsProviderFactory`) and standardized internal article format (`InternalArticle`).

2.  **Market Overview Generation:**
    *   Implemented automated market overview synthesis pipelines for both news sources:
        *   **RealTimeNews Pipeline:** Multi-step process involving title triage (Cohere), selective content fetching (Diffbot), selective summarization (Cohere), and final synthesis (Cohere).
        *   **Trading Economics Pipeline:** Leverages scraper's pre-fetched summaries, using Cohere for title triage and Gemini (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`) for final synthesis.

3.  **Economic Calendar:**
    *   Integrated a RapidAPI endpoint (`economic-events-calendar.p.rapidapi.com`) to fetch economic events.
    *   Implemented frontend display with date range and importance filtering.
    *   Added **Contextual LLM Interpretation:** Utilizes Gemini to explain the significance of individual calendar events, considering the market overview generated from Trading Economics news for added context.

4.  **Earnings Calendar & Analysis:**
    *   Integrated **FMP API** for fetching upcoming earnings calendar data by date range.
    *   Integrated **Mboum API** (using `earnings` and `earnings-trend` modules) to retrieve historical earnings performance and analyst estimate revision trends.
    *   Implemented **On-Demand LLM Analysis:** Allows users to trigger a Gemini-powered analysis for specific tickers, synthesizing historical performance (beats/misses) with recent estimate trends to provide context for upcoming earnings.

5.  **Backend & Infrastructure:**
    *   Set up core services including Express.js server, logging (Winston), environment variable management (`dotenv`), Redis caching, and Supabase for data storage.
    *   Implemented basic API routing and service structure.
    *   Addressed critical bugs related to API response parsing (Diffbot) and error handling to improve server stability.

## Current Status:

*   Core functionalities are operational.
*   Recent fixes addressed server stability issues stemming from scraper errors and LLM model selection.
*   Focus is shifting towards refinement, reliability, and validation of generated content.
